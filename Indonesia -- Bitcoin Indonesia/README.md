## 📖 About Us
We are a non-profit, Bitcoin-only organisation that aims to empower Indonesia through Bitcoin by providing free and open-source education, creating local communities, and a circular economy. We now host 20+ meetups across the country, give presentations at schools and universities, have an online education hub, and run regular workshops at the Bitcoin House Bali. With the Bitcoin House Bali, we provide a physical space for everyone interested in learning and experiencing Bitcoin in real-life. It's a safe space to ask questions, try out hardware, rent out books, meet like-minded people, participate in hands-on workshops, buy bitcoin, etc. Our mission is to make Bitcoin easily accessible to everyone in Indonesia and to create as many touchpoints as possible.

## 👥 Our Team
Bitcoin Indonesia was founded by the 4 co-founders Diana (from Germany), Marius (from Germany), Dimas (from Indonesia) & Petras (from Lithuania). However, now there are around 21 local community leaders & volunteers from Indonesia and abroad who contribute to the project by running meetups, growing local communities, writing articles for the education hub, etc.
